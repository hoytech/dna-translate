=head1 NAME

dna-translate - Search DNA for coding sequences

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a simple lisp program that implements the genetic code. It is BSD licensed so you can do whatever you want with it. 

Given a DNA sequence, the program will find coding regions in all 3 read frames. In addition, it will search the reverse complement frames unless in single-stranded mode. Circular DNA strands (ie plasmids) are supported when in circular mode (implemented with nconced cyclical lists).

Included is a parser for L<GenBank genetic code specifications|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/taxonomyhome.html/index.cgi?chapter=cgencodes> in case you wish to use an alternate genetic code. In addition to the standard code, vertebrate mitochondrial and yeast mitochondrial codes are included.

Note that this is mostly a demo and not a serious project like L<cl-bio|https://github.com/slyrus/cl-bio>.
